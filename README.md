# Land-Price-Prediction

This [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/hussainalqatari/land-market-in-saudi-arabia) has been scrapped off sa.aqar.fm to obtain land information such as price,
size, street width, and locations. The uncleaned dataset scrapped 2952 rows. The majority of the data is unfortunately lands based in Riyadh,
but there are a good number of lands in Jeddah and Khobar.


In this Repo, I have collected more data using web scrapping from the same source https://sa.aqar.fm/. The new data are in two files land_north_riyadh.csv with 17189 rows
and land_riyadh.csv with 7824 rows. And then used the data to develop a deep learning model.
